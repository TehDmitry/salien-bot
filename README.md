### salien-bot

Salien bot is a WIP for the Salien Minigame that came out for Steam Summer Sale 2018.

I picked this up because it reminded me of a challenge in programming I had before. I won't be manipulating any state, just injecting mouse clicks and other button presses.

To use, copy and paste index.user.js in console, or use GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey and visit https://github.com/meepen/salien-bot/raw/master/index.user.js

Also, a note: playing this game AT ALL will not net you better rewards! It's only the time you have been on the page. No need to waste computer resources :)

## Tile selection

Currently, the tile select code focuses on levelling up to level 9 on hard tiles; after you hit level 9 it will try and target the highest progress tile
